## What is RADTorch ?
<p style='text-align: justify;'>

RADTorch provides a framework of higher level classes and functions that significantly reduce the time needed for implementation of different machine and deep learning algorithms on DICOM and non-DICOM medical images.

RADTorch was built by radiologists for radiologists so they can build, test and implement state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in minutes.

RADTorch is :

- User-Friendly: Minimal coding required.

- Comprehensive: Includes data analysis and visualization.

- Backed by state-of-the-art machine learning and data visualization frameworks.
